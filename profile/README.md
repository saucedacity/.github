# Hi there! We're the Saucedacity team!
We're the team behind the audio editor **Saucedacity**, which is a fork of
Audacity without updating and telemetry, plus new features and some planned
major reworkings.

We're more than just that, however. We also intend to maintain any downstream
dependencies for Saucedacity under this organization, at least for the time being.
Basically, the same people behind Saucedacity also maintain downstream dependencies
for Saucedacity.

If you want to contribute, start with one of our repositories below. Feel free
to work on any dependency or, better yet, Saucedacity itself! Become a top
contributor and you might find yourself on the Saucedacity team! Of course,
it's not always about code though; contributions to documentation, for example,
are always accepted.

Bye for now! We hope to see you around soon, whether a contributor, an
end-user, or just someone who stumbled upon our GitHub profile page. :)
