# Hi there! :wave: We're the Saucedacity team! :smile:
## Who We Are
We're the team behind the audio editor **Saucedacity**, which is a fork ofAudacity without updating and telemetry, plus new features and some planned
major reworkings.

**We're more than just that, however**. We also intend to maintain any downstream dependencies for Saucedacity under this organization, at least for the time being. Basically, the same people behind Saucedacity also maintain downstream dependencies for Saucedacity.

## How To Join the Saucedacity Team
**Want to join the Saucedacity Team? You've come to the right spot! We're looking for interested contributors!**

There's really no official process to join the Saucedacity Team. All you need to do is start a discussion or open an issue in [our Saucedacity repo](https://github.com/saucedacity/saucedacity). In the future, we will start to offer the position to top contributors that contribute to Saucedacity or one of our libraries.

Being on the Saucedacity team has its benefits: you can help decide the direction of not just Saucedacity, but also any one of our libraries (depending on what position you get assigned to). You essentially become one of the mainy project leaders on the Saucedacity Team, in charge of a specific field in a specific project.

Bye for now! We hope to see you around soon as a contributor, an end-user, or just someone who stumbled upon our GitHub profile page :wave: :smile:
